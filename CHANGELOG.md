# Changelog

All notable changes to `ob` will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] - Unreleased

### Added

- `ob serve` — local HTTP server exposing ob's full capability surface with
  OAuth2 Authorization Code + PKCE authentication
- `ob mcp` — serve interface URLs as MCP tools for AI agents (Cursor, Claude
  Desktop, etc.) via stdio or HTTP transport
- Delegate system — pluggable binding executors (`exec:ob`, HTTP delegates)
  configured in `config.json`
- Context management — global credential and header storage for API
  authentication, accessible via CLI and `ob serve`
- SSRF protection on `/resolve` endpoint
- OpenBindings Interface discovery at `/.well-known/openbindings`
- `ob validate`, `ob diff`, `ob compat` — interface authoring and comparison
  tools
- `ob sync` — synchronize OBI documents with binding sources

### Changed

- Delegates and contexts are now stored in the environment-level `config.json`,
  replacing the previous workspace model
- `ob mcp` now takes interface URLs as positional arguments instead of reading
  from a workspace file
- OAuth tokens are validated through a single store with TTL eviction (fixes
  memory leak in earlier builds)

### Removed

- **Workspaces** — the workspace concept (`ob workspace`, `ob target`,
  `ob input`) has been removed entirely. Delegates and contexts are managed
  directly in the environment configuration.
- TUI browser — replaced by [Panjir](https://panjir.com), a dedicated web UI
  that connects to `ob serve` as an OpenBindings host
